Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) aka Annualised Returns
========================================================

Do you ever wonder how much are the returns on your investments in the voilatile financial market?

Fret no more. 

With the Compound Annual Growth Rate calculator at  https://seemingli.shinyapps.io/Compound_Annual_Growth_Rate_Calculator, you can know the CAGR or annualised returns on your investments instantaneously.

What is Compound Annual Growth Rate?
========================================================

- the average annual growth rate over a period of time longer than 1 year
- particularly useful for measuring returns on investment which could be highly voilatile from year to year
- Mathematical Formula :

$$ (\frac{Ending Value}{Beginning Value}) ^{1/number of years} - 1 $$

Example
========================================================
If the value of your investments are as voilatile like this example, you may like to use CAGR to see how the investment fared over different periods like CAGR over 3 years, 5 years and 10 years.
***
```{r,echo=FALSE}
Value<-c(200,190,235,175,213,197,253,246,317,278,300)
Year<-c(2005:2015)
df<-data.frame(Year,Value)
cat(Value)
plot(df,ylim=c(0,320),type="l",col="blue")
```

Easy-to-use App
========================================================
Just key in the Beginning Value & Ending Value of your investment and the number of years between the beginning and ending years & voila, you'll have the CAGR instantaneously for comparison!
